# Summer Internship Hiring Challenge
## Problem Statement
The script requires email address and list of favourite TV series for multiple users as input. The prompt needs to be as follows:
- Email address:
- TV Series:
- Store the input data in MySQLdb table(s).

## Desired Output
A single email needs to be send to the input email address with all the appropriate response for every TV series. The content of the mail could depend on the following use cases:

- email.mime.text for email
- requests for web mining
- re for regular expressions
- BeautifulSoup for web mining
